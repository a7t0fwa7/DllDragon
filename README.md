# Dynamic Windows API Resolver
A simple single-include utility that makes runtime winapi resolving a breeze.
Using `LoadLibraryA` and `GetProcAddress` manually each time you want to use an api can be cumbersome and error-prone,
especially with the need to repeatedly cast function pointers to the correct types.
This project aims to take away that complexity.


### Usage
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "resolver.hpp"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) 
{
    auto pMessageBoxA = WinApi("user32.dll", MessageBoxA);
    if (!pMessageBoxA) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to resolve api" << std::endl;
        return -1;
    }

    pMessageBoxA(NULL, "hello world", "hello world", MB_OK);
}
```

As you can see - `user32.dll` is not found under the `Module Name` column.
