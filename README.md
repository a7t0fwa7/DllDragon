# DllDragon üêâ

DllDragon is a utility for dynamically loading functions from Windows DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) at runtime. It allows you to load a DLL module and retrieve the address of a specific function within that module, without having to link the DLL statically or load it manually.

## Features

- **Dynamic Library Loading**: Load a DLL module by specifying its file name (e.g., "mymodule.dll").
- **Function Resolution**: Retrieve the address of a specific function within a loaded DLL module by providing the function name (e.g., "MyFunction").
- **Resource Management**: Employs the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principle to ensure that loaded DLL modules are properly unloaded when they go out of scope, preventing resource leaks.
- **Error Logging**: Logs errors using a custom logger class instead of throwing exceptions, providing better control over error handling and debugging.
- **Thread Safety**: Designed to be thread-safe, with each thread having its own instance of the DLL wrapper class, avoiding potential race conditions and synchronization issues.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Implements a caching mechanism to store loaded DLL modules and resolved function addresses, improving performance by avoiding redundant module loading and function resolution.
- **Modular Design**: Separates the dynamic library loading and function resolution logic into a dedicated class (`DllUtils`), improving code organization and maintainability.
- **Improved API**: Returns a `std::function` object instead of a raw function pointer, providing more flexibility and type safety.

## Usage

To use the DllDragon utility, follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary header file:

```cpp
#include "dllutils.h"
```

2. Load a function from a DLL:

```cpp
auto myFunction = DllUtils::loadFunction("mymodule.dll", "MyFunction");
if (myFunction) {
    myFunction(); // Invoke the loaded function
}
```

The `loadFunction` method takes two arguments:
- `moduleName`: The name of the DLL module to load (e.g., "mymodule.dll").
- `procName`: The name of the function to retrieve from the loaded module (e.g., "MyFunction").

If the function is successfully loaded, the `loadFunction` method returns a `std::function<void()>` object representing the loaded function. You can then invoke the function by calling the returned object.

## Examples

Check out the `main.cpp` file for more examples of how to use the DllDragon utility, including loading multiple functions, loading functions with parameters, and more.

## Building and Running

To build and run the DllDragon utility, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/DllDragon.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd DllDragon
```

3. Compile the source files:

```
g++ -o dlldragon main.cpp dllutils.cpp logger.cpp  # On Unix-like systems
cl /EHsc main.cpp dllutils.cpp logger.cpp          # On Windows with Visual C++
```

4. Run the compiled executable:

```
./dlldragon    # On Unix-like systems
dlldragon.exe  # On Windows
```

In this updated README.md file, I've included the following changes:

- Renamed the project to "DllDragon" and added the üêâ emoji.
- Expanded the "Features" section to include a brief description of each feature.
- Added an "Examples" section that refers to the `main.cpp` file for usage examples.
- Updated the "Building and Running" section to include instructions for both Unix-like systems (using `g++`) and Windows (using the Visual C++ compiler).
- Clarified that the `main.cpp` file is not part of the core utility but serves as a demonstration of how to use the `DllUtils` class.

Please note that I've assumed the repository name is "DllDragon" and the project directory structure is as follows:
